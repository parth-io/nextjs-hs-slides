                    However, there is a blog post from Next's author that is a bit more relevant to explaining the
                    motivations for Next,

                <p>
                    I recommend checking out this blog post if you're interested in the topic, but let's go over these
                    principles quickly.
                </p>
                <b>Server rendered pages are not optional</b>
                <p>
                    We're familiar with how a conventional Single Page App (SPA) works.
                    No matter the request, the server returns the same initial response: an HTML page with little
                    besides link and script tags.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The client-side JS renders a loading UI and makes additional HTTP requests to get the data needed to
                    finish rendering the UI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using this method, we increase latency, increase time to a fully rendered UI, and for that we get
                    decreased Time To First Byte (TTFB) and faster page loads after the initial js bundle is loaded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The alternative to this is confusingly called Server-side rendering. It should really be called
                    something else to distinguish it from a conventional server-rendered web application.
                    It is also confusingly referred to as client-side hydration. See <a
                        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate">ReactDom.hydrate()</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SSR typically eliminates the first request for data from client-side rendering so that the first UI
                    that the user sees is already populated with their data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right away the user can click links. Initially they will trigger a full page load. This is good: if
                    a user is on a mobile device with a weak processor and slow connection,
                    it can take a while for the client bundle to initialize. Once the client has initialized, the client
                    functions like a traditional SPA.
                </p>
                <b>Act immediately on user input</b>
                <p>
                    Pretty straightforward, but this just means that layout changes shouldn't require full page loads.
                </p>
                <b>React to data changes</b>
                <p>
                    When data changes on the server, the client should be updated without the user needing to refresh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you sign out on one tab, you should be signed out in all other tabs for the same site.
                    If open an email in one tab, the email should be marked as read in another tab.
                    If the user closes their laptop, and then opens it later, their newsfeed should show the most recent
                    posts, or at least let them know that there are more recent posts that they can load.
                </p>
                <b>Control the data exchange with the server</b>
                <p>
                    Quote: We can now fine-tune the data exchange with the server. Make sure to handle errors, retry on
                    behalf of the user, sync
                    data on the background and maintain offline caches.
                </p>
                <b>Don’t break history, enhance it</b>
                <p>
                    If you've worked on an SPA before you know that this isn't easy.
                </p>
                <b>Push code updates</b>
                <p>
                    Another common pitfall of SPAs, what happens when a user on your site and you deploy an update? In a
                    traditional web app, a page reload will fix that.
                </p>
                <b>Predict behavior</b>
                <p>
                    This means that you should do things like intelligently preload resources before users actually need
                    them.
                </p>

            <h2>Page Routing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    By default, Next.js will map requests to components in <code>/pages</code>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ex: <b><code>/about-us</code></b> loads <b><code>/pages/about-us.js</code></b></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is really nice, but will become irrelevant when you need dynamic routes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The way you implement dynamic routes is by using Next.js programatically.

                <li>Incremental static generation</li>

            <h2>Server-side rendering</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    SSR is enabled by implementing <code><b>getServerSideProps()</b></code> method on page
                    components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This function will be called by the server on every request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Used typically your page needs to pre-render frequently updated data
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Static site generation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    SSG is enabled by implementing <code><b>getStaticProps()</b></code> method on page
                    components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This function will only be called at build time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Should be the default for content websites, because pages can be cached
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Incremental Static Regeneration</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To use ISR, add the <code><b>revalidate</b></code>  prop to <code><b>getStaticProps</b></code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    This function will update static pages after you’ve built your site, without needing to rebuild the entire site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rebuilds the page after the specified interval
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Client-side Rendering</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First method: use <code><b>useEffect</b></code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second method: use a data fetching library like <a href="https://swr.vercel.app/">SWR</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    For client interactivity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Better than a pure React SPA, because JavaScript can re-render parts of the page without requiring a full page refresh
                </li>
                <li>
                    No SEO

            <ul>
                <li>Each page is bundled with all of it's imports.</li>
                <li>Code to run additional pages is imported when you navigate to a different page.</li>
                <li>Fetching happens off main UI thread in a serviceWorker</li>

                <li>
                    <code><b>Link</b></code> component for client side routing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prefetching can be done with Link or imperatively.
